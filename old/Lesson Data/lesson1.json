        "section": "Opening",
        "teacher_dialogue": "Before we learn any words, we're going to make a few sounds. You've probably heard that isiXhosa has 'click' sounds. This might sound difficult, but you already have all the parts in your mouth to make them. We're just going to put them together in a new way. We'll take it one sound at a time.",
        "justification": "This opening immediately **reframes the clicks from an 'impossible foreign sound' to a manageable combination of existing abilities**. By acknowledging potential difficulty but presenting a clear path, it **lowers learner anxiety** and sets the expectation of introducing concepts 'one thought at a time'. This is crucial for managing the high cognitive load associated with these novel sounds."
      },
      {
        "turn_number": 2,
        "section": "Introducing the Dental Click ('c' /ǀ/)",
        "teacher_dialogue": "Let's start with the letter **'c'**. To make this sound, I want you to do something you've probably been told *not* to do. Make a **'tsk-tsk' or 'tut-tut' sound**, the one you might make if you're disappointed. Place the tip of your tongue against the back of your top front teeth and suck in a little air. Try it: **'c, c, c'**. \n\nNow, let's put that sound with a vowel. We'll add 'ala' after it. The word for 'side' is **cala**. Listen: **'Ca-la'**. The click happens, and the rest of the word follows immediately. **'Cala'**. Your turn.",
        "justification": "This step **imports knowledge** from a known, non-linguistic sound and action, making the abstract sound concrete and less intimidating. Presenting it as slightly 'taboo or funny' can make it more memorable. By immediately applying the isolated sound to a simple word, learners understand its utility in context, rather than just learning an abstract sound. This is part of **masked repetition**, integrating the new sound into high-frequency vocabulary."
      },
      {
        "turn_number": 3,
        "section": "Introducing the Lateral Click ('x' /ǁ/)",
        "teacher_dialogue": "Next is the letter **'x'**. This sound is used to call horses. Place your tongue as if you're going to make a 'k' sound, but instead of pushing air out, suck air in from the side of your mouth. It's the sound you'd make from the side of your cheek. Try it: **'x, x, x'**.\n\nNow let's use it. The word to 'criticise' is **gxeka**. Listen: **'Gxe-ka'**. The click is part of the first syllable. **Gxeka**. Your turn.",
        "justification": "Similar to the 'c' click, this uses **conceptual importation** by drawing on a familiar non-linguistic analogy (calling horses) to make the sound more accessible. Integrating the sound into a new word immediately reinforces its practical application and continues the **masked repetition** strategy."
      },
      {
        "turn_number": 4,
        "section": "Introducing the Palatal Click ('q' /ǃ/)",
        "teacher_dialogue": "The last one for today is **'q'**. This is like the sound of a **cork popping from a bottle**. Curl the tip of your tongue up to the roof of your mouth, create suction, and then release it downwards sharply. It's the loudest of the three. **'Q, q, q'**.\n\nLet's use it to say 'start'. The word is **qala**. Listen: **'Qa-la'**. **Qala**. Your turn.",
        "justification": "This analogy uses a strong, memorable, and descriptive sound (popping cork) to explain the click's quality and articulation mechanism, again **importing knowledge** and **reframing** the sound as approachable. Ending with a useful and symbolic word like 'start' provides a sense of accomplishment and directly relates the new sound to meaningful communication, setting a positive tone for continued learning."
      },
      {
        "turn_number": 5,
        "section": "Closing",
        "teacher_dialogue": "Well done. You've just made the three main click sounds in isiXhosa. We have **'c'** (like tsk-tsk), **'x'** (for the horses), and **'q'** (the popping cork). We'll practice these as we go, so **don't worry about them being perfect yet**. You've already started (uqalile).",
        "justification": "This summarises the key learning points and explicitly **cues the learner that initial perfection is not the goal**, which is vital for **managing cognitive load** and encouraging relaxed, natural acquisition over time. It reinforces that continuous practice will occur through **masked repetition** in subsequent lessons. By using a previously learned word ('uqalile'), it also subtly weaves in early vocabulary, showing immediate application."
